# SPI-DA-Pixel-by-pixel-imaging-measurements-via-MLP-classification
We found that the classification of single-pixel program measurements can be quickly completed using MLP, which can avoid excessive and unnecessary image calculations during the imaging process.


1. Chuli.py to get data.
2. SPI-DA.py is experimental code.

Suggestion：
1、You can try MNIST or MNIST-FASION as the dataset.
2. Mask could be a random binary group of codes with 0 and 1 as the pixels.

We will put the our experimental datasets later.
